      <p>While researching the static-site generator (SSG) scene for the first time in a while yesterday, I happened upon  <a href="https://www.hardypress.com">HardyPress</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting proposition: it takes the whole WordPress-to-SSG idea one step further. HardyPress keeps your WordPress install on a hidden location where you edit to your heart’s delight, and only <strong>then</strong> does the content get on the Web—but as <em>static</em> files. So you get the advantage of ease-of-use in WordPress and the security of SSG.</p>
<p>In addition, they host it on a CDN that, as nearly as I can tell, uses Amazon to hit 30 edge servers worldwide. They even provide SSL certs so you can avoid the nasty red blot on Chrome, Firefox, and other HTTPS-savvy browsers.</p>
