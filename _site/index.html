    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
<p>Eons ago, when <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">the Web was a new thing</a> and people still capitalized <em>Web</em>, consarn it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">ISPs</a> tended to provide free file space for people to have <a href="https://consumerist.com/2015/03/20/where-did-everyone-from-the-90s-go-when-we-all-got-facebook-and-quit-web-1-0/">little personal Web sites</a>. Back in those days, one did so with whatever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> client one could find, what we now know as static <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">HTML</a> files (but not <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/">CSS</a>, not yet anyway), and lots and lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dial_up_modem_noises.ogg">dialup modem noise</a>.</p>
<p>And, yes, I had one, back on what then was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTE">GTE.net</a>. In fact, I was a “Charter Subscriber” to that ISP.</p>
<p>[[IMAGE WILL GO HERE]]</p>
<p>Yet, as that free-file-space thing gradually went away, so, too, did many personal sites—mine among them.</p>
<p>Over the years, database-driven content management systems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system">CMSs</a>) like <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> appeared. They provide click-and-drag ease in building a personal site, but they tend to be <a href="https://ithemes.com/2017/01/16/wordpress-security-issues/">security nightmares unless properly maintained</a>, which many aren’t. They also introduce a great deal of technical overhead.</p>
<p>And then there are creatures like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, which <a href="https://ia.net/topics/take-the-power-back">for all too many people</a> have become the only Web-based locations for ordinary folks’ thoughts. Of course, <a href="https://adammclane.com/2013/03/in-social-media-you-are-the-product/">all these platforms want</a> is to grab your information, show you ads, and—particularly in the case of Facebook—contribute to the <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/07/16/how-social-media-is-dumbing-down-our-communication/">dumbing-down of your culture</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585317305208">political polarization of your society</a>. What’s the harm??!?</p>
<p>(Don’t worry. This site is, and will remain, apolitical by design unless we’re nearing World War III or something along those lines. Maybe even then, since I doubt my little ol’ site is going to stop The Really Big One.)</p>
<p>Anyway, it seemed a lot of the fun had gone out of puttering around on the Web and actually creating content. Then—first among the techno-cognoscenti and, more recently, among us ordinary folks—came Web sites powered by <a href="https://www.staticgen.com">static site generators (SSGs)</a> and written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. I found them a source of curiosity at first but gradually became more interested in the prospect, especially as I learned more about their <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-ditch-cms-static-site-generator/">technical advantages</a>; and, so, here we are.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by. I hope you find this site a source of various little nuggets of helpful info, and occasionally a laugh or two—even if I hadn’t intended it, but especially if I had.</p>
<p>Again, welcome.</p>
